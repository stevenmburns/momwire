"""momwire against nec2c, fixture by fixture (issue #792, unit 3).

``tests/test_portal.py`` pins the printout's *shape*: same sections, same
columns, same token arity.  This file pins its *numbers*.  Every committed
oracle deck is run through our daemon in-process, both printouts are read by
ONE parser written to ``nec2/Execute``'s token positions, and the parsed values
are compared.

Nothing here needs the oracle binary — the fixtures are committed and the
daemon is a library call.  The whole file is under two seconds.

What "agreement" means
----------------------
nec2c is a pulse-basis point-matched NEC-2 and momwire is a B-spline Galerkin
solver.  They will never agree digit for digit and SimNEC does not need them
to: it reads two numbers per ANTENNA INPUT PARAMETERS row and builds a Y
matrix.  The bar is that a design tuned against one engine behaves the same
against the other, so the default tolerance is **5 % relative** on impedances
and port currents and **±0.5 dB** on pattern gain.

Measured at authoring time (2026-08-08, momwire 0.23.0, nec2c 5b4az.ae6ty.1.17;
the five ``dipole_rp*`` cliff/gain-only rows added 2026-08-09 for issue #802;
the three network rows retired 2026-08-15 for #930, and
``dipole_gd_second_medium`` 2026-08-19 for #458) — worst case over every
row of every table in each fixture:

===================================  ======  ======  ======  ======  =====

"I curve" is the CURRENTS AND LOCATION table normalised by its own peak ROW,
complex — so it asks whether this is the same current DISTRIBUTION (relative
magnitude and relative phase, segment for segment, in the same tag order) and
leaves the overall complex scale to the port test above.  That split is what
makes (a) legible: the short loaded dipole's distribution agrees to 2.2 %, and
all 45 % of its port disagreement is the one global factor.  Peak-gain
direction agrees exactly (0 steps) on both pattern fixtures.

Two fixtures need more than 5 %, and both are the same phenomenon — a small
residual between two large, nearly cancelling numbers:

(a) ``catalog_dipoles_short_dipole_loaded``: a 0.25 λ dipole with a 4.65 µH
    coil at the feed.  At 28 MHz that coil is +818 Ω, cancelling almost all of
    the antenna's own capacitive reactance.  ``Re(Z)`` agrees to 1.8 %; the
    reactance differs by 8.4 Ω, which is **1.0 % of the coil**.  The 45 % is
    the residual, not the physics.
(b) was ``dipole_nt_network``, retired from this table in #930 along with the
    two ``dipole_tl_*`` rows and footnote (d): ``TL`` and ``NT`` are out of the
    engine's dialect now, which is antenna-only, and all three decks are
    REFUSAL fixtures — see ``test_nec_portal.py``'s ``NETWORK_FIXTURES``. The
    scores they carried (0.27 %, 1.14 %, 1.31 %, and the residual mechanism
    behind the last one) are kept in the git history of this docstring rather
    than deleted, because they are what said the network translation was
    right while it existed.
(c) ``split_dipole_qq`` (the jar test deck's YY-free successor, #839):
port 1 is the gap at the centre of a full-wave split
    dipole, a current null with ``|Z| ≈ 3.5 kΩ``.  High-|Z| feeds are the known
    basis-sensitive class (antennaknobs #459); the deck's other two ports agree
    to 0.4 %.

Each of those is asserted at its own tolerance below, WITH the identity that
makes it benign, so a future regression that is not this phenomenon still
fails.

(d) recorded the ``TL`` decks' exposure to the same cancellation — a line at
    an odd quarter wave is an impedance INVERTER, so a small basis difference
    at the far end comes back magnified at the near one. Retired with (b).

(e) is a control rather than a measurement (issue #800). Both ``MP`` fixtures
    are ``dipole_free_space``'s geometry plus one card, and both reproduce its
    row to the digit on BOTH engines — which is the claim the card's whole
    treatment rests on: ``MP`` describes how the oracle fills and factors, not
    what it computes, so there is nothing in it for momwire to honour. If these
    rows ever drift away from ``dipole_free_space``'s, the card has stopped
    being advisory and this engine is wrong to ignore it.

(g) are the ``RP`` cliff modes (issue #802), and they are the quietest rows in
    this table rather than the loudest — which was not the expected result.
    The medium selection is a per-SEGMENT, per-DIRECTION discrete choice, and
    the two engines do not share a discretisation: nec2c partitions nine pulse
    segments, momwire partitions its own B-spline elements, so near the angle
    where the reflection point crosses the edge the two engines put slightly
    different amounts of current on each side. The fear was a few dB at
    grazing, where a wrong medium shows up worst. Measured, every grazing row
    of both fixtures sits at **exactly -0.070 dB** — one constant offset,
    identical to the offset on the rows where no segment crosses at all, so
    it is the pair's ordinary basis difference and the cliff contributes
    nothing on top of it. The straddle band was deliberately placed inside the
    grid (theta 60 and 70 of a 0-80 sweep) so that this could be read rather
    than assumed; see ``scripts/nec_portal_capture.py`` for how the numbers
    were chosen.

(h) ``dipole_rp_gain_only`` is the ``RFLD = 0`` form, and it is a control on
    the range as well as a capture of the shape: its gain columns must — and
    do — reproduce the same deck's at 1000 m to the digit, because gain never
    depended on the range, while every E column moves by three decades. The
    two thresholds nec2c spells 1e-20 come apart exactly here, which is what
    ``test_nec_portal.py``'s gain-only pair asserts directly.

(f) is the same kind of control, for ``GD`` (issue #800's tail). The fixture
    is its ground fixture plus one card — ``dipole_sommerfeld_ground`` — and
    reproduces its base row to the digit on BOTH engines. (Its PEC twin,
    ``dipole_gd_second_medium`` over ``dipole_pec_ground``, carried the same
    control at 2.23 % until #458 made a second medium under a ``GN 1`` a
    refusal — the MININEC-type ground idiom. The two cliff fixtures, which
    ARE that ground and do read the record, keep the PEC half of the claim.)
    That is the claim GD's treatment rests on: NEC-2 uses the second medium
    in the FAR FIELD only, and there only in ``RP``'s cliff modes, so nothing
    in the matrix can see it. If that row ever drifts away from its base's,
    the card has stopped being inert for the impedance path and this engine
    is wrong to record it and move on.
    Since #802 the far-field half is no longer "and there we refuse": the
    cliff modes run, so the same control is asserted on them too, by
    ``test_the_cliff_never_reaches_the_matrix``.

(i) are the two ``EK`` fixtures, added to this table in issue #849 when the
    card stopped being advisory (momwire 0.26.0 ships NEC's extended thin-wire
    kernel; the portal now builds the group's solver with it). Both moved, and
    both moved the way the card's own arithmetic says they must: these are
    0.001 m wires at ``Δ/a ≈ 500``, where the O(a²) term the extended kernel
    restores is worth **0.017 %** — measured, on both — and agreement with
    nec2c went from 0.761 % to 0.745 %. ``dipole_ek_rearm``'s FIRST group is
    ``EK -1`` and did not move at all, to the digit, which is the reduced path
    still being the reduced path. The card's real magnitude cannot be read off
    this corpus at all (no committed deck is fat enough); it is measured
    against the oracle in ``test_nec_portal.py``'s fat-wire pair, where
    ``Δ/a = 2.27`` and both engines move ~8 %.

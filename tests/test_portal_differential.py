"""momwire against nec2c, fixture by fixture (issue #792, unit 3).

``tests/test_portal.py`` pins the printout's *shape*: same sections, same
columns, same token arity.  This file pins its *numbers*.  Every committed
oracle deck is run through our daemon in-process, both printouts are read by
ONE parser written to ``nec2/Execute``'s token positions, and the parsed values
are compared.

Nothing here needs the oracle binary — the fixtures are committed and the
daemon is a library call.  The whole file is under two seconds.

What "agreement" means
----------------------
nec2c is a pulse-basis point-matched NEC-2 and momwire is a B-spline Galerkin
solver.  They will never agree digit for digit and SimNEC does not need them
to: it reads two numbers per ANTENNA INPUT PARAMETERS row and builds a Y
matrix.  The bar is that a design tuned against one engine behaves the same
against the other, so the default tolerance is **5 % relative** on impedances
and port currents and **±0.5 dB** on pattern gain.

Measured at authoring time (2026-08-08, momwire 0.23.0, nec2c 5b4az.ae6ty.1.17;
the five ``dipole_rp*`` cliff/gain-only rows added 2026-08-09 for issue #802;
the three network rows retired 2026-08-15 for #930 and RESTORED 2026-08-20 for
momwire#456 phase C, which also added four more of them; and
``dipole_gd_second_medium`` retired 2026-08-19 for #458) — worst case over
every row of every table in each fixture:

===================================  ======  ======  ======  ======  =====

"I curve" is the CURRENTS AND LOCATION table normalised by its own peak ROW,
complex — so it asks whether this is the same current DISTRIBUTION (relative
magnitude and relative phase, segment for segment, in the same tag order) and
leaves the overall complex scale to the port test above.  That split is what
makes (a) legible: the short loaded dipole's distribution agrees to 2.2 %, and
all 45 % of its port disagreement is the one global factor.  Peak-gain
direction agrees exactly (0 steps) on both pattern fixtures.

Two fixtures need more than 5 %, and both are the same phenomenon — a small
residual between two large, nearly cancelling numbers:

(a) ``catalog_dipoles_short_dipole_loaded``: a 0.25 λ dipole with a 4.65 µH
    coil at the feed.  At 28 MHz that coil is +818 Ω, cancelling almost all of
    the antenna's own capacitive reactance.  ``Re(Z)`` agrees to 1.8 %; the
    reactance differs by 8.4 Ω, which is **1.0 % of the coil**.  The 45 % is
    the residual, not the physics.
(b) ``dipole_nt_network``: the NT branch (j0.02 S) drives most of the current
    that would otherwise flow in the driven segment, so the segment current
    printed in STRUCTURE EXCITATION DATA is a residual and differs by 12 %.
    The number SimNEC actually reads — the ANTENNA INPUT PARAMETERS *source*
    current — agrees to 1.3 %.

    This row and the two ``dipole_tl_*`` ones were RETIRED in #930, when the
    dialect went antenna-only, and restored by momwire#456 phase C.  They came
    back at 1.31 %, 0.27 % and 1.14 % — the same three numbers to the
    hundredth that they carried before, from a translation written fresh
    against the same oracle.  That is the strongest single statement in this
    file about the network semantics being right, and it is why the scores
    were kept in prose across the retirement rather than deleted.
(c) ``split_dipole_qq`` (the jar test deck's YY-free successor, #839):
port 1 is the gap at the centre of a full-wave split
    dipole, a current null with ``|Z| ≈ 3.5 kΩ``.  High-|Z| feeds are the known
    basis-sensitive class (antennaknobs #459); the deck's other two ports agree
    to 0.4 %.

Each of those is asserted at its own tolerance below, WITH the identity that
makes it benign, so a future regression that is not this phenomenon still
fails.

(d) is a *near* miss worth recording rather than an outlier. ``TL`` decks are
    exposed to the same cancellation the three above are: a line at an odd
    quarter wave is an impedance INVERTER, so a small basis difference at the
    far end comes back magnified at the near one, and two branches across one
    pair of gaps make a loop whose port admittance is a residual. The first
    draft of ``dipole_tl_shunt_crossed`` hung its NT back across the same pair
    as the TL and measured 6.6 % — 5x the same deck with the NT chained onto a
    third dipole (1.14 %), for a structure whose printout layout is identical
    either way. The committed decks are the chained ones; nothing here needs a
    widened bar, and if a future TL fixture does, this is the mechanism to
    check first.

(e) is a control rather than a measurement (issue #800). Both ``MP`` fixtures
    are ``dipole_free_space``'s geometry plus one card, and both reproduce its
    row to the digit on BOTH engines — which is the claim the card's whole
    treatment rests on: ``MP`` describes how the oracle fills and factors, not
    what it computes, so there is nothing in it for momwire to honour. If these
    rows ever drift away from ``dipole_free_space``'s, the card has stopped
    being advisory and this engine is wrong to ignore it.

(g) are the ``RP`` cliff modes (issue #802), and they are the quietest rows in
    this table rather than the loudest — which was not the expected result.
    The medium selection is a per-SEGMENT, per-DIRECTION discrete choice, and
    the two engines do not share a discretisation: nec2c partitions nine pulse
    segments, momwire partitions its own B-spline elements, so near the angle
    where the reflection point crosses the edge the two engines put slightly
    different amounts of current on each side. The fear was a few dB at
    grazing, where a wrong medium shows up worst. Measured, every grazing row
    of both fixtures sits at **exactly -0.070 dB** — one constant offset,
    identical to the offset on the rows where no segment crosses at all, so
    it is the pair's ordinary basis difference and the cliff contributes
    nothing on top of it. The straddle band was deliberately placed inside the
    grid (theta 60 and 70 of a 0-80 sweep) so that this could be read rather
    than assumed; see ``scripts/nec_portal_capture.py`` for how the numbers
    were chosen.

(h) ``dipole_rp_gain_only`` is the ``RFLD = 0`` form, and it is a control on
    the range as well as a capture of the shape: its gain columns must — and
    do — reproduce the same deck's at 1000 m to the digit, because gain never
    depended on the range, while every E column moves by three decades. The
    two thresholds nec2c spells 1e-20 come apart exactly here, which is what
    ``test_nec_portal.py``'s gain-only pair asserts directly.

(f) is the same kind of control, for ``GD`` (issue #800's tail). The fixture
    is its ground fixture plus one card — ``dipole_sommerfeld_ground`` — and
    reproduces its base row to the digit on BOTH engines. (Its PEC twin,
    ``dipole_gd_second_medium`` over ``dipole_pec_ground``, carried the same
    control at 2.23 % until #458 made a second medium under a ``GN 1`` a
    refusal — the MININEC-type ground idiom. The two cliff fixtures, which
    ARE that ground and do read the record, keep the PEC half of the claim.)
    That is the claim GD's treatment rests on: NEC-2 uses the second medium
    in the FAR FIELD only, and there only in ``RP``'s cliff modes, so nothing
    in the matrix can see it. If that row ever drifts away from its base's,
    the card has stopped being inert for the impedance path and this engine
    is wrong to record it and move on.
    Since #802 the far-field half is no longer "and there we refuse": the
    cliff modes run, so the same control is asserted on them too, by
    ``test_the_cliff_never_reaches_the_matrix``.

(i) are the two ``EK`` fixtures, added to this table in issue #849 when the
    card stopped being advisory (momwire 0.26.0 ships NEC's extended thin-wire
    kernel; the portal now builds the group's solver with it). Both moved, and
    both moved the way the card's own arithmetic says they must: these are
    0.001 m wires at ``Δ/a ≈ 500``, where the O(a²) term the extended kernel
    restores is worth **0.017 %** — measured, on both — and agreement with
    nec2c went from 0.761 % to 0.745 %. ``dipole_ek_rearm``'s FIRST group is
    ``EK -1`` and did not move at all, to the digit, which is the reduced path
    still being the reduced path. The card's real magnitude cannot be read off
    this corpus at all (no committed deck is fat enough); it is measured
    against the oracle in ``test_nec_portal.py``'s fat-wire pair, where
    ``Δ/a = 2.27`` and both engines move ~8 %.

(j) are the two geometry-replication fixtures of momwire#415, captured
    2026-08-19 when the dialect learned ``GX`` and ``GR``. Both are ordinary
    rows — three and five parallel elements, no ground, no loading — and both
    are deliberately framed with a ``GW`` AFTER the replication card, which
    retires the symmetric cell. With the symmetry still live at ``GE`` the
    oracle would fill and factor on one cell and print a cell count this
    engine has no equivalent of, and the printout would stop being comparable
    row for row; that is a different fixture and a different question. This
    pair measures what the corpus mostly needs — the EXPANSION, which is 30 of
    its 36 ``GX``/``GR`` decks. Their numbers agree; their STRUCTURE
    SPECIFICATION bytes do not yet, which is ``test_portal.py``'s
    ``test_portal.REPLICATED_SPEC_NAMES``.

(k) ``dipole_ex6_gyrator`` is the manufactured ``EX 6`` current source — a
    phantom wire on tag 9901, an ``EX 0`` volt on it, and a gyrator ``NT``
    (Y12 = j1) turning that into an amp at the real segment. 52 of the 457
    models 4nec2 bundles arrive this way, so this row is a corpus-coverage
    claim rather than a physics one, and its number says so: 0.76 %, which is
    ``dipole_free_space``'s own row to the digit. The gyrator forces the
    current, so the two engines are being asked the same question about the
    same dipole and the network contributes no disagreement of its own. The
    phantom sits 991 wavelengths away and both engines agree it is
    electromagnetically irrelevant (measured, phase C M3/M4).

(l) ``dipole_ld_nt_colocated`` puts an ``LD`` and an ``NT`` on ONE segment,
    which is the composition question rather than either card's own: NEC puts
    the load on the impedance matrix's diagonal, in series inside the segment,
    and composes the network on top of the admittance that results. The two
    orders are a series and a parallel connection of the same two elements and
    they are far apart — stamping the load as a second branch across the port
    instead moves this row to 19 %, so the 0.88 % is load-bearing.

(m) ``dipole_nt_all_zero``'s far endpoint is an OPEN gap, and both engines
    print round-off in its excitation row (nec2c 1.5e-17 A against ours
    1.1e-18). Nothing compares that row — the tables this file reads are the
    ANTENNA INPUT PARAMETERS and CURRENTS ones — and the 0.52 % is the driven
    port, which is perfectly well conditioned. The deck is here because an
    engine that treated an all-zero card as a no-op would SHORT that gap
    instead of opening it, and would then be answering a different antenna at
    a number that still looks reasonable.

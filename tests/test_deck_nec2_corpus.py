"""Parse agreement: ``momwire.deck``'s nec2 front-end vs antennaknobs.

The nec2 dialect spec (``site/src/content/docs/reference/deck-grammar-nec2.md``,
appendix ``#appendix-differences-from-antennaknobs-importer``) says the two
readers "agree on everything load-bearing for geometry: ``GW``, ``GM``,
``GS``, free-format tolerance, fused mnemonics, ``(tag, segment)`` addressing,
and the connection tolerance and snapping — that code is shared, not merely
equivalent."  This module is the measurement behind that sentence, run over
the 45-deck reference corpus, using antennaknobs' ``nec_import`` — a reader
independently written and maintained outside momwire — as the oracle:

  * the flat NEC wire list after every ``GM``/``GS`` transform and both
    connection passes — tag, segment count, both endpoints, radius;
  * the junction cut set, against antennaknobs' own ``_junction_cuts``;
  * the shattered pieces, against the spans antennaknobs' ``wire_tuples()``
    emits for the same wires;
  * ``(tag, segment)`` resolution, against ``nec_import._locate_segment``;
  * the resolved ``(wire, arclength)`` of every ``EX``/``LD``/``PT`` address
    in the deck, as a POINT IN SPACE — checked against both the flat wire's
    own segment centre and the arclength antennaknobs' polyline translation
    lands the same feed on.  The last comparison is a tolerance rather than a
    bitwise one: the two paths sum a different partition of the same
    polyline, so their arclengths differ by float summation order alone; and
  * GN/GD retention, FR/EX/LD-LD5 semantics, and RLC loading — against the
    portal's own parser and ``antennaknobs.network``'s formulas (momwire#359
    unit C).

This module used to also compare the SOLVE — the same decks built onto a
solver by ``momwire.deck.build_solver`` and by antennaknobs' own portal path,
at the port admittance matrix, bitwise (momwire#359 unit D).  That comparison
ran 41/41 bitwise once (#363) and is recorded history, but phase II of the
portal extraction (#846) rewired antennaknobs' portal onto ``build_solver``
itself, so it had come to compare the pipeline with itself rather than an
independent assembly path.  #373 decided to drop it rather than repair it:
the fixture battery (real nec2c captures) is what now carries solve-level
equivalence, and this module is reduced to what remains two independently
written readers — the parse-agreement subset.

antennaknobs is not a momwire dependency and will never be one, so the whole
module skips when it is not importable — which is every CI run.  To run it,
build one venv with momwire editable FIRST and antennaknobs editable
``--no-deps`` second (antennaknobs pins an exact momwire, which must not
displace the checkout under test).

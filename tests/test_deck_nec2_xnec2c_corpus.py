"""``GX``/``GR`` over the xnec2c example corpus (momwire#415).

Issue #415 opened on a census: intersecting each of the xnec2c project's
example decks with this dialect's refuse-by-name table made ``GR`` the single
largest geometry blocker in the set — bigger than ``TL`` — and ``GX`` the
fourth.  Units 1-3 built both cards, the symmetric cell they declare, and the
cell rule for ``LD``.  This module is the acceptance measurement the issue
asked for, and the numbers below are what it actually reads rather than what
the issue predicted; where the two differ, the difference is recorded here and
in the report, not smoothed over.

Two questions, both over the same corpus:

  1. **Do the decks parse?**  The issue named 18 decks "blocked by nothing
     except ``GX``/``GR``" that "would go straight from refused to accepted".
     Measured, 13 of them do.  The other five are blocked by something the
     census could not see, because the census intersected MNEMONICS with the
     refuse-by-name table and these five refuse by FIELD or by rule:
     ``10-30m-box``, ``10-30m_bipyramid``, ``T12m-H24m`` and ``T20m-H18m``
     each carry a ``GN 0`` with a radial ground SCREEN (a field of the ``GN``
     card, and no screen model exists here); and ``1MHz_tower`` trips unit 3's
     out-of-cell ``LD`` refusal.  ``_EXPECTED`` below records the whole
     36-deck outcome, deck by deck, so a change in any of it is visible.

  2. **Is the expansion exact?**  The transferable property of #415 — "a deck
     using ``GX``/``GR`` must solve identically to the same deck with those
     cards expanded into explicit ``GW`` cards" — rests entirely on the
     expansion being right.  Unit 1 checked that ad hoc against antennaknobs'
     ``nec_import``, an independently written and maintained reader of the
     same cards; ``test_the_expansion_matches_the_reference_bitwise`` makes it
     permanent, over both cards' decks, on tags, segment counts, endpoints and
     radii, BITWISE.

Neither the corpus nor antennaknobs is a momwire dependency, and neither is
present on CI, so the whole module skips when either is missing.  Point
``MOMWIRE_XNEC2C_EXAMPLES`` at a checkout of xnec2c's ``examples/`` directory
to run it.

"""Authenticode-sign the frozen EZNEC drop-in.

Signing is OPT-IN and driven entirely by the environment, so an unconfigured
build behaves exactly as it always has — unsigned, no signtool required, and
runnable on a box (or a Linux runner) that has no Windows SDK at all:

Two signing identities exist, and UNSET-BOTH IS THE OFF SWITCH — with
neither variable set the build is unsigned and no signtool is required:

``MOMWIRE_SIGN_METADATA``
    Path to an Azure Artifact Signing metadata file (account, certificate
    profile, region endpoint).  Requires ``MOMWIRE_SIGN_DLIB`` — the path to
    ``Azure.CodeSigning.Dlib.dll`` from the Microsoft.ArtifactSigning.Client
    NuGet package — and the three ``AZURE_*`` credential variables signtool's
    dlib reads.  WINS over ``MOMWIRE_SIGN_SHA1`` when both are set, so a tag
    build cannot accidentally sign with a rehearsal certificate left in the
    environment.
``MOMWIRE_SIGN_SHA1``
    SHA-1 thumbprint of a code-signing certificate in the Windows certificate
    store — the self-signed rehearsal, or a hardware token.
``MOMWIRE_SIGN_TIMESTAMP_URL``
    RFC-3161 timestamp authority.  Defaults to DigiCert's; CI sets Microsoft's
    on every path so the canary exercises the TSA the release depends on.
``MOMWIRE_SIGN_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED``
    ``1`` downgrades the ``signtool verify /pa`` chain check from a gate to a
    printed note.  This is for the SELF-SIGNED REHEARSAL only: a self-signed
    certificate cannot chain to a trusted root, so /pa always fails, and
    without this the rehearsal could never pass.  Leave it unset for a real
    certificate — then a broken chain correctly fails the build.
``SIGNTOOL``
    Explicit path to ``signtool.exe``, skipping the Windows Kits search.

Why a store thumbprint and not a .pfx for the local seam: since June 2023 the
CA/Browser Forum baseline requires code-signing keys to live on FIPS-140-2
Level 2 hardware, so there is no importable key file to point at any more.  A
store thumbprint is what both a hardware token and a self-signed rehearsal
cert present, which is why the rehearsal exercises the real code path rather
than a stand-in.  A cloud-HSM CA (Azure Artifact Signing here) identifies the
key through ``/dlib`` plus a metadata file instead — `_identity_args()` is
the one CA-specific stanza, and the rest holds for both.

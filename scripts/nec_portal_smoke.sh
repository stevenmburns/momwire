# Hand smoke test for the momwire SimNEC portal daemon (issue #792).
#
# The unit suite proves the printout is right. This proves the PROCESS is
# right — the part a SimNEC session actually depends on and that no in-process
# test can see:
#
#   * `-version` prints exactly the one line `Execute.testCommand()` parses;
#   * three real decks go down ONE resident process, in order, each answered
#     with its own `NX` data-card echo (the sentinel `processResponse` blocks
#     in `readLine()` waiting for — miss it and the SimNEC UI hangs forever,
#     with no timeout on the Java side);
#   * it all works from a working directory that has nothing to do with the
#     checkout, because SimNEC launches the engine through `sh -c` with
#     cwd=$HOME.
#
# Run it before pointing a live SimNEC at a new build:
#
#     bash scripts/nec_portal_smoke.sh
#
# PYTHON overrides the interpreter (default: the repo's .venv, else python3).

"""Roy's coupled-loop model under the two pulse-charge solvers (AK#982 lanes).

Same deck as ladder_dense.py — W7EL's NEC-2/NEC-4 pathology model (500 Hz,
free space, -j404.7 kV at the z=20 knot's segment) — pushed through
PulseSolver (nodal point charges) and HarringtonSolver (dual-cell charge).
Neither takes a junction spec: coincident ends are found from the geometry,
so the three-wire base junction is expressed by the wire list alone.

Two questions, matching the thread:
  1. the k-ladder at 500 Hz: source current + max loop element |I| — does a
     pulse charge model put spurious current in the loop the way NEC-2's
     quadrature error does (162 A on a sub-ampere source), or stay in the
     NEC-5/bspline class (~0.48 A)?
  2. the 1/f sweep (50 kHz .. 5 Hz at fixed k): the loop/source ratio —
     flat = clean, climbing ~10x per decade downward = the NEC-2 defect.

Writes results-pulse.json next to this script:
  {engine: {"ladder": {str(k): [Re I_src, Im I_src, max loop |I|]},
            "fsweep": {str(f_mhz): ratio}}}

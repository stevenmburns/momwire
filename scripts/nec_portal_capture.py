"""Capture NEC-2 printout from SimNEC's own oracle engine (issue #792, unit 1).

SimNEC drives its NEC engine as a *resident* child process: it writes a NEC-2
card deck to the child's stdin, terminates the deck with an ``NX`` card, and
parses classic NEC-2 printout back off the child's stdout.  The child stays
alive for the next deck.  We are going to reimplement that child on top of
momwire, so we first need byte-level ground truth for what the real engine
prints.

Regenerating needs two things this repo does not depend on: the oracle
binary (see :func:`find_oracle`) and, for the ten ``catalog_*`` decks only,
an importable ``antennaknobs`` — they are exported from its design registry
(see :func:`_catalog_decks`).  Neither is needed to USE the fixtures.

This script builds a small, deterministic corpus of decks in SimNEC's *portal
dialect* (the card subset ``nec2/NECSource`` actually emits — CM/CE, EK, GW,
GM, GS, GE, GN, GD, LD, IS, EX, NT, TL, FR, RP, NE, NH, PT, MP, XQ, plus
terminated by ``NX`` — Ward's custom ``YY`` retired in #839), runs each one
through the oracle binary, and
commits the deck/printout pairs as fixtures under
``tests/fixtures/nec_portal/``.

CI never has the oracle binary.  The fixtures are committed precisely so that
the fast tests (``tests/test_nec_portal_fixtures.py``) and the later units'
conformance tests can run without it.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/nec_portal_capture.py            # regenerate fixtures
    python scripts/nec_portal_capture.py --check    # verify committed fixtures

``--check`` regenerates into a temporary directory and diffs against the
committed tree, exiting non-zero on any drift.  That is the idempotency gate:
re-running the capture must produce byte-identical fixtures.

Determinism
-----------
The oracle prints wall-clock timings ("FILL: 1 msec", "Somnec Computation Time
30", "TOTAL RUN TIME: 0 msec") that genuinely vary run to run.  Those lines are
canonicalised to zero by :func:`canonicalize_timings` before the printout is
written.  Nothing else is touched: the fixtures are otherwise verbatim oracle
output, and the canonicalised lines keep their exact column layout so the
grammar they demonstrate stays valid.

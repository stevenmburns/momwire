"""Port-based network spec for transmission lines and lumped elements.

A `Network` describes how the antenna's feed-edges (named real ports) and
purely-logical nodes (virtual ports) hook together via two-port branches.
Engines consume the network as a post-processing layer on top of the
multi-port antenna Y matrix: every branch and source stamps into one
Modified Nodal Analysis system (see `._reducer`), which is solved for the
driven-port impedances and the physical port voltages in one shot.

Arrived from antennaknobs per ``docs/design/networks-move-into-the-engine.md``
(momwire#456 workstream 2, phase B), near-verbatim: this is the circuit half
of that repo's ``network.py``. Two things changed deliberately in the move,
both recorded where they land:

* `Cable` is promoted here as the formal line-spec type, and
  `TL.from_cable` now takes one instead of a catalog name — momwire carries
  no catalog, and name -> spec resolution belongs to the caller (the
  ``CABLES`` dict stays in antennaknobs with the rest of the physical stock).
* `Network` is FLAT. The authoring hierarchy (`Composite`/`Instance` and its
  flattening) stays in antennaknobs, which flattens before handing momwire a
  Network; ``branch_paths`` therefore becomes a passable field rather than a
  derived one, so the app's hierarchy layer can still attribute power-budget
  rows to the box they came from.

Docstrings below keep their antennaknobs vocabulary where it names the
CALLER's contract rather than anything here: ``build_wires()`` tuples,
``designs/...`` showcases, ``station``/``schematic``/``touchstone``/
``ferrite`` modules, and `Instance`'s dotted-node convention all live in
antennaknobs, which is the consumer of this module.

    midpoint; PyNEC: segment (n_seg+1)//2 — identical placement for odd
    segment counts, which named port wires should therefore use). A port
    must interrupt a current path, so it lives in a wire's interior, never
    at an endpoint — to put a feed "at" some point of a structure, author
    a short named wire there.

    This is the only port type that touches geometry (contrast
    `PortVirtual`, a pure circuit node): it becomes one row/column of the
    antenna's multiport short-circuit Y that the network stamps onto.

    ``distributed=True`` makes the port a FINITE gap spanning the whole
    named wire instead of a delta gap on one segment: the excitation is a
    constant field over the wire's fixed physical length (one sub-feed per
    segment, voltages split by length), and the port row of Y is the
    length-weighted contraction of the sub-feed rows. A delta gap's
    readout moves whenever mesh refinement subdivides the port wire (the
    gap narrows with the segment — issue #477's port-drift class:
    sterba_tl's pinned ports, zepp's jump when its port wire first
    subdivides); the finite gap's width is set by geometry, not by the
    mesh, so the port impedance is mesh-stable by construction and the
    port wire may refine like every other wire. The value it converges to
    is the finite-gap answer for THAT physical width — for the short port
    stubs this models, within a couple percent of the delta-gap limit,

    knows gap voltage and gap current, so every delta gap is inherently a
    floating two-terminal object. This port type stops imposing the bond.

    The two terminals are addressed as dotted sub-nodes — ``"feed.p"`` and

    not a detail of construction — it changes the constitutive law, because the
    current in the common section is the *difference* of the input and output
    currents rather than a ratio-scaled copy.

    So this is not modelled as an ideal ratio. It is two **mutually coupled
    inductors** in series up one leg:

        datum ──[ l_lower ]── a (tap) ──[ l_upper ]── b (top)

    with mutual ``M = k·√(l_lower·l_upper)`` between them, stamped as two
    Group-2 branch-current rows plus their off-diagonal coupling. The turns
    ratio, the magnetizing behaviour, and the loss all fall *out* of that L/M
    matrix instead of being asserted — which is the point: an ideal-ratio model
    would get the common-section current wrong.

    In the ideal limit (``k`` → 1, inductances ≫ the load reactance) it
    reproduces the textbook tapped ratio

        n = 1 + √(l_upper / l_lower)          (turns go as √L on one core)

    so the impedance at the tap is the load at the top divided by n² —

    ``ql`` gives both sections the same finite Q (core + winding loss as a
    series r = ωL/Q, the ``ql`` convention used elsewhere); it itemizes in the

    two windings exchange.

    ``k`` must satisfy 0 ≤ k ≤ 1. Above 1 the inductance matrix stops being
    positive semi-definite — M² > L₁L₂ means the pair can deliver more energy
    than it stores — and the element would quietly generate power. SimSmith

class BalancedLine:
    """Balanced / differential two-conductor transmission line (issue #575) —
    the differential sibling of `TL`. Where a `TL(a, b)` is single-ended (each
    end referenced to the one network common), a BalancedLine models a pair of
    conductors carrying ±I with the return current riding the *partner* wire:
    open-wire feeder, twisted pair, the Sterba curtain's offset-pair verticals.

    Four terminals in two pairs — port A = ``(a1, a2)``, port B = ``(b1, b2)``,
    the two ends of the 2-conductor line. It is characterised by a single
    **differential impedance ``zdiff``** (the number off the ladder-line spool:
    300 / 450 / 600 Ω) plus physical ``length``, ``vf``, and optional
    matched-loss ``k1``/``k2`` — mirroring `TL`. For anyone coming from the
    microwave even/odd convention, ``zdiff = 2·z0o``.

    **Differential by default, with an optional common-mode path** (``zcomm``,
    issue #576). The default ``zcomm=None`` stamps only the odd-mode block,
    which structurally forces ``I(a1) = −I(a2)`` at each end — exactly the ±I
    cancellation the Sterba pair relies on, enforced by construction. That
    default follows the physics of an isolated pair: it supports exactly one
    TEM mode (the differential one); the even ("common") mode's return is a
    third conductor that isn't there, its Z0 is ill-defined, and even-mode
    current is really antenna-mode current that radiates, which a network
    branch cannot faithfully represent.

    BUT — the #576 end-to-end finding — a differential-only stamp also
    deletes the pair's *conductor continuity*: a real pair, however tightly
    coupled, still transports its end-to-end common-mode boundary condition,
    and in multi-loop structures (the multi-bay Sterba curtain) that
    constraint is load-bearing even where the CM *current* is small (measured
    5–15% of DM there, yet its removal costs 5 dB and steers the beam). Set
    ``zcomm`` — the pair-driven-as-one-conductor CM impedance — to add the
    orthogonal even-mode block and restore the path. Honesty notes: at
    resonant lengths (≈ k·vf·λ/2, e.g. the Sterba's risers) the CM line is a
    repeater and results are insensitive to the value (measured identical
    over 25–400 Ω), so any plausible number is fine; away from resonance
    ``zcomm`` is a genuine approximation for a radiating path — estimate it
    from geometry and treat results accordingly. The CM stamp still cannot
    radiate; a structure whose riser antenna-mode current matters beyond its
    boundary condition needs real wires.

    Stamped through the shared `NetworkReducer` as one chain-matrix 2-port
    per mode (issue #746): in differential variables it is an ordinary 2-port
    TL with z0 = zdiff, carried on the pair incidence (+1, −1) at each end;
    ``zcomm`` adds a second, orthogonal 2-port on the (½, ½) common-mode
    incidence — the exact even/odd decomposition, no cross-terms, so the
    differential behaviour is untouched. ``_reduce.balanced_admittance_4x4``
    is the closed 4×4 form of the same thing, kept as the oracle. A lossless
    line at exactly k·vf·λ/2 is an ordinary
    through-line here (the addendum below); real open-wire ``k1`` loss is
    still worth giving the exactly-λ/2 riser, but for its physics rather than
    to dodge a pole.

    Addendum 2026-08-06 (issue #746): before the chain-matrix stamp, a
    lossless k·vf·λ/2 line RAISED — the 4×4 admittance form has a pole
    there — and designs carried length fudges to avoid it. That is gone; the
    half-wave case is now the best-conditioned length there is.

    **No ``transposed`` flag**: with four explicit terminals a crossover (the
    Sterba's half-twist) is just wiring port B as ``(b2, b1)`` — visible in
    the design source. (A crossover flips only the differential sign; the CM
    block is symmetric under it.)

    With ``zcomm=None`` the common mode is structurally open (the 4×4 is
    rank-2 by construction), so each terminal node must be
    common-mode-determinate from elsewhere — attached to a radiating wire
    (`PortOnWire`), driven, or wired to a non-BalancedLine branch. A node
    reachable *only* through CM-open BalancedLine terminals is rejected by
    `Network.__post_init__` (it would make MNA singular at solve time); a
    ``zcomm``-carrying BalancedLine is itself a common-mode return, so its
    terminals count as determinate.

    Both engines stamp it through the shared `NetworkReducer` (a pure
    admittance block, no native NEC card — exactly like `TL`, `Shunt`,
    `Transformer`, `Admittance`), so PyNEC and momwire agree on it to
    MoM-basis tolerance and nec2++ serves as an independent oracle for the
    differential stamp. There is no native-card path: NEC-2 has no coupled-
    line card, but the reducer never needed one. (Physics validation of the
    differential *model* against real coupled structures — the isolation
    oracle and end-to-end TL Sterba — is issue #576.)

    Constructing one from the line's physical dimensions instead of a spool
    label lives with the wire catalogs it needs, in antennaknobs
    (``BalancedLine.from_geometry`` / ``two_wire_params``): geometry
    resolution is app-side, and this class takes the resulting
    ``zdiff``/``vf`` like any other.

class FloatingBalun:
    """Floating-secondary transformer / link-coupling — the differential twin
    of `Transformer` (issue #589). Where `Transformer` spans both windings
    node-to-datum (a single-ended:single-ended balun *ratio*, but NOT the
    unbalanced↔balanced *transition*), a FloatingBalun has a single-ended
    **primary** (``primary`` node to the datum, e.g. a 50 Ω rig) and a
    genuinely **floating differential secondary** — the terminal pair
    ``(a, b)``, neither leg bonded to the datum. It is the one primitive that
    closes the balanced chain ``Driven → rig → FloatingBalun → balanced tuner
    → BalancedLine → antenna`` to a datum-locked source without injecting the
    common-mode current a balanced feed exists to avoid.

    Reference topology: the Palstar BT1500A "double roller balanced tuner"
    places a 1:1 choke (current) balun at its 50 Ω input, converting the
    unbalanced coax to a balanced condition for the floating L-network; the
    balun is literally the first component and sits at the benign resistive
    input on purpose. `FloatingBalun(n=1)` is that element.

    ``n`` is the primary→secondary ratio in the constitutive relation

        v(a) − v(b) = n · v(primary)        (v(primary) is vs. the datum)

    so the *differential* impedance across the floating secondary is referred
    to the primary as ``Z_primary = Z_secondary / n²`` — a 1:1 balun (``n=1``,
    no loss) presents the balanced load impedance to the rig unchanged, and a
    4:1 current balun stepping a 200 Ω balanced load down to 50 Ω at the rig
    is ``n=2``. ``n = 1`` is a legal ideal element (no value is inverted);
    ``n = 0`` is rejected at stamp time (it would pin the secondary
    differential voltage to 0 — no physical balun does that).

    Loss model, mirroring `Transformer` (minimal, shape-of-the-curve only):
      r     — series winding resistance in Ω, referred to the secondary
              (constitutive row v_a − v_b − n·v_primary = r·j, j the
              secondary current);
      lmag  — magnetizing / choke inductance in H, shunted across the primary
              node to the datum: at low frequency ωL_mag stops dwarfing the
              source and insertion loss rises, the classic balun low-end
              rolloff. This models the *balun's own* common-mode choking and
              is distinct from `BalancedLine.zcomm` (the *line's* CM path);
      qlmag — finite Q of the magnetizing branch (core loss), same
              convention as `Transformer.qlmag` / `ql` elsewhere.

    Common-mode note: the constitutive row constrains only the secondary
    *differential* voltage; the secondary common mode ``(v_a + v_b)/2`` is
    genuinely floating (an isolated winding), and the element draws zero
    common-mode current (``I(a) = −I(b)`` at the element by construction).
    So the secondary pair needs a common-mode return from elsewhere — the
    antenna it feeds (a radiating structure grounds it), or a
    ``zcomm``-carrying `BalancedLine` — exactly like a CM-open `BalancedLine`
    terminal, and `Network.__post_init__` enforces this.

    Reducer-only on both engines, like `Transformer` (there is no native NEC
    card for an ideal transformer); its dissipation itemises in the power
    budget (issue #299)."""

        """A CM-open `BalancedLine` (``zcomm=None``) stamps only the
        differential block, contributing nothing to its terminals' common
        mode; a `FloatingBalun`'s secondary pair ``(a, b)`` is likewise
        CM-floating — its constitutive row constrains only the differential
        voltage and the element draws zero common-mode current (issue #589).
        A node reachable ONLY through such terminals is common-mode floating,
        which makes the MNA singular at solve time — raise a clear,
        node-naming error here at build time instead. A node is
        common-mode-determinate if it is a real `PortOnWire` or `PortAtEnd`
        (an antenna-Y row grounds it), is driven by a source, is referenced by
        any non-BalancedLine branch or by a ``zcomm``-carrying BalancedLine
        (its CM block is itself a return), or is a `FloatingBalun` *primary*
        — issues #575/#576/#589.

        The primary is pinned by the element's CONSTITUTIVE ROW, not by any
        path to the datum: ``v_a − v_b − n·v_p = r·j`` determines ``v_p`` once
        the secondary pair is determinate (which the check above already
        requires), and ``n = 0`` is rejected at stamp time so the coefficient
        is never zero. The datum path one might reach for — the magnetizing
        shunt ``G[p, p] += y_mag`` — is stamped only when the element declares
        a magnetizing branch, and both `station.floating_balun` and
        `station.balanced_l_tuner` default ``lmag_uH=None``, so for the common
        ideal-balun case there is no such path at all (issue #660)."""

"""Engine-agnostic reduction of a port-based `Network` spec to driven-port
impedances, on top of a raw multiport antenna admittance matrix.

Arrived from antennaknobs per ``docs/design/networks-move-into-the-engine.md``
(momwire#456 workstream 2). This module is the TYPE-FREE half — the TL/chain
math and the MNA core, which never see a port name or a branch dataclass. The
spec layer landed alongside in `._spec` and `NetworkReducer` in `._reducer`
rather than appended here: `._spec` reuses `_series_rlc_impedance` below, so
keeping the three apart is what makes the arrows acyclic.

antennaknobs' MomwireEngine and PyNECEngine assemble the antenna's short-circuit
Y at the real (`PortOnWire`) ports, then hand it here with a port-name -> matrix-
index map. This module stamps the network branches and sources into one
Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) system — the SPICE formulation, issue #285 —
and solves it once for everything: driven-port impedances, physical port
voltages for the excited far-field/current solve, and the source-power /
load-dissipation bookkeeping. The only engine-specific work is producing the
raw Y and the index map; the linear algebra here is identical regardless of
which MoM solver produced Y.

This is the EZNEC-style approach: model transmission lines and lumped
elements as a circuit post-process on top of the field solution, rather than
via NEC2's native `tl_card` / `nt_card` / `ld_card`.

The node space is the port space: one node per port (real feeds first,
virtual ports after), every node's voltage referenced to the common return
(the datum). The datum has no matrix row — every port's second terminal is
bonded to it, which is the same convention the antenna's short-circuit
multiport Y already assumes. Elements that a bare admittance matrix cannot
represent — ideal voltage sources, ideal shorts, 0 Ω / 0 H series elements —
become Group-2 unknowns: the branch current joins the solution vector with a
constitutive row, so no element value is ever inverted.

Issue #746 pushed that principle through the two places it was still being
violated. Transmission lines are stamped as their CHAIN matrix rather than
their admittance (two branch currents each), because a k·λ/2 line has no
admittance matrix at all while its ABCD is [[±1, 0], [0, ±1]]. And the
impedance/Γ solve stamps each driven port's EMF behind a reference impedance
rather than pinning the node, because Z_s = 0 is what made a short across the
port unsolvable — Z = E/j − z_ref is the same answer, Γ comes out natively,
and an open reads a finite +1 instead of ∞. The excited / far-field solve
keeps the ideal generator, deliberately: see `excited_state`.

    mode is structurally open (rank 2) and ``I(a1) = −I(a2)`` is forced at
    each end — the ±I differential cancellation, enforced by wiring. There is
    no ``transposed`` flag: a crossover is wiring port B as ``(b2, b1)``.

    ``zcomm`` (issue #576's end-to-end finding) adds the orthogonal
    common-mode block — the pair driven as ONE conductor against the network

    The ¼-ones incidence annihilates differential vectors, so the CM block
    never perturbs the differential behaviour — the exact even/odd

    when (and how honestly) a CM path can be modelled at all.

class _Group2Element:
    """One Group-2 (auxiliary-current) element of the MNA system.

    The element carries a branch current ``j`` flowing a → b *through* the
    element (``None`` = the datum, which has no matrix row). KCL: ``+j``
    leaves node a and enters node b. The constitutive row is

        c_v · (v_b − v_a) + c_j · j = e

    Two scalings describe the same physical series branch — an EMF ``emf``
    (oriented to raise the potential from a to b) in series with impedance
    ``z`` = 1/``y``:

      impedance form:  (v_b − v_a) + z·j = emf      (c_v=1, c_j=z, e=emf)
          exact for every finite z, including the ideal short z = 0;
      admittance form: y·(v_b − v_a) + j = y·emf    (c_v=y, c_j=1, e=y·emf)
          exact for every finite y, including the ideal open y = 0.

    Each branch picks whichever form keeps its coefficients finite, so no
    element value is ever inverted — the reason ideal shorts and trap-
    resonance opens need no special-case guards here.

    Generalization for coupled elements (issue #301, the Transformer):
    ``ka``/``kb`` scale the KCL currents (``ka·j`` leaves node a,
    ``kb·j`` enters node b — an ideal transformer's windings carry
    ratio-linked currents, so kb = n), and ``c_va``/``c_vb``, when set,
    replace the symmetric ``∓c_v`` voltage coefficients of the
    constitutive row with

        c_va · v_a + c_vb · v_b + c_j · j = e

    (the transformer's row is v_a − n·v_b − r_w·j = 0). Defaults keep
    every pre-existing series element bit-identical.

    Third terminal (issue #589, the FloatingBalun): an optional node ``c``
    with KCL scale ``kc`` (``kc·j`` leaves node c, same sign convention as
    node a) and voltage coefficient ``c_vc`` adds a third column/row so a
    single branch current can couple three distinct nodes — a
    floating-secondary transformer whose primary lives on its own node ``c``
    while the differential secondary spans ``a``/``b``. Its constitutive row
    is v_a − v_b − n·v_c = r·j (c_va=1, c_vb=−1, c_vc=−n), and reciprocity
    pins kc = c_vc = −n (the row equals the current column, as for a/b), so
    the ideal element is lossless. ``c=None`` (the default) is a plain
    two-terminal branch, bit-identical to before.

    Arbitrary arity (issue #746, the chain-matrix lines): ``terms`` — a
    sequence of ``(node, k, c_v)`` triples with the same meanings (``k·j``
    leaves ``node``; ``c_v·v_node`` appears in the constitutive row) —
    REPLACES a/b/c entirely when set. A `BalancedLine`'s differential
    chain-matrix row spans four terminals (a1, a2, b1, b2), one more than
    the a/b/c form can name, and a chain matrix also needs terminals whose
    voltage it senses without drawing current (k = 0) — neither fits the
    two-scaling shape above.

"""`NetworkReducer`: the spec layer stamped into the MNA core.

Arrived from antennaknobs per ``docs/design/networks-move-into-the-engine.md``
(momwire#456 workstream 2, phase B), near-verbatim — the tail of that repo's
``network_reduce.py``. The type-free half it stands on (the TL/chain math and
the MNA primitives) landed first in `._reduce`; the ports, branches, sources
and flat `Network` it reads live in `._spec`. Three modules rather than the
one the file came from, because a single module could not both define the
spec and be imported by it: `._spec` reuses `._reduce`'s
`_series_rlc_impedance`, so the reducer — which needs BOTH — is its own
module and the arrows stay acyclic.

A caller's engine assembles the antenna's short-circuit Y at the real
(`PortOnWire`) ports, then hands it here with a port-name -> matrix-index map.
Everything below stamps the network branches and sources into one Modified
Nodal Analysis system and solves it once for everything: driven-port
impedances, physical port voltages for the excited far-field/current solve,
and the source-power / load-dissipation bookkeeping. The only engine-specific
work is producing the raw Y and the index map.

The power-budget label strings the probes carry are a FROZEN cross-repo
contract (antennaknobs#956): antennaknobs' schematic layer pattern-matches
them, so they moved here spelled exactly as they were and are not to be
reworded until the structured-probe replacement lands. That replacement's
momwire half is in: every probe (`apply_branches`, ~line 334 on) now also
carries a structured `(instance_path, branch_index, subprobe)` key, and
`excited_state`'s ``budget`` exposes it as `_BudgetEntry.key`. The freeze
stays ON here — the antennaknobs schematic consumer has not switched to the
structured key yet — until that side lands and lifts it on both.

        impedance changes the operating point but not the ratio, and

                         ``(label, watts)`` (issue #956) and additionally
                         carries ``.key`` — ``(instance_path, branch_index,
                         subprobe)`` — a structured identity a consumer can
                         match on instead of the label string.

        The termination branches carry the physical port currents, so the
        source power reads directly off the solution vector:

            p_in   = ½ Σ Re(E_k · j_k*)          (E = 0 terms vanish)

        This path deliberately keeps the IDEAL-generator stamp (``z_ref = 0``)
        while the impedance/Γ path uses `Z_REF_DEFAULT` — a second solve, not
        an rcond-triggered fallback (issue #746). Two reasons. The port
        voltages here *are* the excitation forced into the MoM solver and the
        normaliser p_in = ½ΣRe(E·j*) is defined at the source terminals, so a
        source impedance would divide the drive and rescale every gain in the
        package. And a fallback would make those numbers depend on a
        conditioning threshold — the same design at two frequencies either
        side of it would report gains normalised differently, silently. The
        cost is one extra (n_ports + n_branches)-sized zgesvx per solve, which
        is nothing beside the MoM factorisation that produced Y, and the two
        systems were already assembled separately anyway.

        The consequence to know: a topology that shorts the driven port (a
        lossless λ/4 open stub across the feed) now has a perfectly good
        impedance answer, Z = 0 / Γ = −1, and still has no far field — the
        current an ideal source drives into a dead short is unbounded, so
        there is nothing to normalise against. That asymmetry is physical.

        Reactive elements burn nothing and report ~0 in the budget.
        Efficiency counts EVERY dissipative network branch — resistive
        TwoPort/Shunt elements and lossy TLs included (issue #299; the
        pre-#299 accounting counted Load terminations only, so designs
        with resistive coupling/matching branches now report a lower,

        Read this way Γ never has a pole. The two cases that break Z break it
        by dividing: a shorted port (a lossless λ/4 open stub, a k·λ/2 shorted
        one) is Γ = −1, and an open port — where j is exactly 0 and Z is
        reported as ∞ — is Γ = +1 exactly, no sentinel and no clamp.

        A forced-current port has no z_ref (Z_s = ∞ is its reference), so its
        Γ is converted from Z; that conversion is the one that can still meet
        an infinity, and it maps to Γ = +1 by the same limit.

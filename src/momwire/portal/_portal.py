"""momwire as a resident SimNEC engine — the ``nec2c`` portal daemon.

SimNEC (``nec2/NEC2Daemon``) starts one NEC-2 process and keeps it: decks
arrive on stdin framed by an ``NX`` card, printouts leave on stdout, and the
Java side blocks in ``readLine()`` until it sees the ``NX`` data-card echo.
This module is that process, with momwire behind it instead of nec2c.
Standalone use (a shell redirect instead of SimNEC) gets one extension the
Java side never exercises: ``EN`` — a stock deck's final card — also
terminates a frame, and ends the run the way genuine nec2c does (#901).

The contract is pinned in ``docs/2026-08-08-simnec-execute-grammar.md``
(issue #792 units 1-3) and in the 36 oracle deck/printout pairs under
``tests/fixtures/nec_portal/``. Everything here — column widths, header
strings, section order, the stderr discipline — is copied out
of those two sources. **Layout is the contract; the numbers are momwire's.**
A different basis and kernel will never reproduce nec2c digit for digit, and
SimNEC does not need it to: it reads exactly two numbers per
``ANTENNA INPUT PARAMETERS`` row (the CURRENT real/imaginary columns, fields 4
and 5 of an 11-token row) and builds its Y matrix from them.

The dialect is momwire's
------------------------
Since #846 phase II this module owns the PROTOCOL and momwire owns the
LANGUAGE. ``momwire.deck.parse(text, dialect="nec2")`` reads the deck against
the normative grammar published at
momwire.dev/reference/deck-grammar-nec2 — every card, every field, every
refusal message — and ``momwire.deck.build_solver`` maps the resulting
dialect-neutral ``DeckModel`` onto a solver family plus the ``PortPlan`` that
says what its ports mean. What is left here is what a solver has no vocabulary
for: NEC's tags and global segment numbers, the column-exact printout, the
resident stdin framing, and the port algebra that stamps a load onto a
solution the fill knows nothing about.

The dialect is **antenna-only**, which is what the restriction buys: a
structure of thin wires, driven by voltage sources, optionally over a ground.
``TL`` and ``NT`` are refused by name — solve the network outside the engine,
or import the deck with antennaknobs, which keeps NEC's full network grammar
(``nec_import.parse_nec``). Across the 44-deck reference corpus the two cards
appear in three hand-authored probe decks and nowhere else; SimNEC's own
``NECSource`` never writes them and its state machine never reads the sections
they would print.

Scope (units 2 and 3 — the whole portal dialect bar the long tail):

* the version probe, the resident stdin loop, the ``NX`` sentinel;
* ``CM``/``CE`` directives ``QQ`` (quiet) and ``FF`` (the one stderr line);
* geometry ``GW``/``GM``/``GS``/``GE``, environment ``GN 0/1/2`` and ``GD``,
  loading ``LD 0/1/4/5``, insulation ``IS``, excitation ``EX 0``, ``FR``,
  ``EK`` (the extended thin-wire kernel, honoured since #849 — every I1
  except -1 enables it, matching nec2c), and ``XQ``; (Ward's ``YY``
  report card was retired in #839 — abandoned upstream, its only sender
  a dev benchmark);
* unit 3: ``RP 0/2/3`` radiation patterns and ``NE``/``NH`` near-field grids
  — each of which is also an *execute* card in its own right (they run the
  pending group, so a bare ``XQ`` after one of them re-runs nothing);
* issue #800: ``MP``, the ae6ty multicore hint SimNEC emits automatically past
  256 segments — parsed, echoed, and its one advisory line reproduced, with the
  ``#Proc``/``blockSize`` numbers deliberately not acted on (see
  :class:`Multiprocessing`) — and ``PT``, which turned out to be a plain
  toggle on the ``CURRENTS AND LOCATION`` table rather than anything entangled
  with the plane-wave excitation SimNEC wraps it in (see
  :class:`PrintControl`);
* issue #800 (tail): ``GD``, NEC-2's additional-ground-parameters card, which
  SimNEC's EZNEC-derived examples carry and forward — parsed, echoed, and
  otherwise inert. **Fidelity note:** ``GD``'s second medium reaches NEC only
  through the far field, and only through the ``RP`` card's cliff and
  ground-screen modes (``RP 1``-``RP 6``); it never enters the matrix, so
  every impedance and current is unchanged by it, and the ``RP 0`` pattern
  this engine computes is byte-identical with and without the card (measured
  both ways on the oracle). The modes where it WOULD move the pattern are
  already refused by name at the ``RP`` card, so nothing here answers a
  second-medium question by pretending the medium is not there
  (see :class:`SecondMedium`);
* the printout sections SimNEC's state machine walks: banner, comments, data
  cards, structure specification, segmentation data, frequency, structure
  impedance loading, antenna environment, matrix timing, antenna input
  parameters, currents and location, power budget, radiation patterns,
  near electric/magnetic fields.

Refused by name, with the grammar's own message: ``TL``/``NT`` (networks),
``GA``/``GH``/``GX``/``GR``/``GC``/``GF`` (geometry out of dialect),
``SY``, ``SP``/``SM`` (surface patches), ``RP`` modes 1 and 4-6, spherical
``NE``/``NH`` grids, ``GN`` radial-wire ground screens, ``EX`` types other
than 0, ``LD`` types 2/3/6/7 and the ranges that cannot expand, and the four
``IS`` cases a lossless whole-wire jacket cannot express. Every one of them
takes the error path below rather than crashing the daemon — the printout says
which card and why, and the ``NX`` sentinel is still emitted.

Where the physics citations point
---------------------------------
Comments below that name a NEC routine — ``FFLD``, ``RDPAT``, ``DB10``, the
main program's card reader — cite the ORIGINAL NEC-2 FORTRAN, a US government
work in the public domain: ``nec2dx.f`` (NEC-2D, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, "FILE CREATED 4/11/80", double-precision revision 6/4/85),
cross-checked against the single-precision ``nec2-1.2.1.2.f`` of the same
lineage, and the equations of the public Program Description (Burke & Poggio,
*NEC-2 Part I: Theory*, cited by equation number). No C translation is cited
anywhere in this file; ``tests/fixtures/nec_portal/README.md`` carries the
provenance record in full.

The architectural win over the oracle
-------------------------------------
SimNEC probes an N-port antenna by writing N ``XQ`` groups, one ``EX`` per
port per group (``nec2/NECSource.sensorLines``), and the oracle re-runs the
whole MoM solve — fill, factor, solve — once per group. It pays N fills for
one matrix.

We do not. A deck's execute groups all share one geometry, so this module
takes the UNION of every group's ``EX`` segment (plus every ``LD`` segment) as
the momwire port set, fills and factors ONCE per (geometry, frequency), and
gets the per-port basis-coefficient columns X out of the same LU
back-substitution that produces the short-circuit Y matrix. Every execute
group after that is linear algebra on cached factors: the group's port
voltages give ``coeffs = X @ V`` and its currents ``I = Y @ V``. N sources
cost one fill, not N.

And the deck need not be the boundary either. The protocol is stateless — a
sweep arrives as N independent decks, each re-sending the whole geometry — but
the ENGINE may remember, so with ``--cache`` a solver is kept ACROSS decks
under a key that is the operator's own identity (``_operator_key``,
``_solver_for``). A knob returned to a value already probed, a restarted
sweep, a crew member handed the same structure at a different frequency:
geometry parse, mesh, port maps and every fill already paid are reused,
bounded by an LRU cap on estimated resident bytes. The printout is identical
either way — that is the whole correctness claim, and it is what the tests
assert.

That is OFF by default. The saving is real and measured on the bench, but the
workload it exploits is a live SimNEC session's re-probe rate, which nobody
has measured — so the shipped default stays the behaviour that has been
validated, and ``--cache-stats PATH`` answers the question first: it counts
what a cache WOULD have served while solving every deck fresh, and writes the
tally to a file after every deck. Nothing about either flag reaches stdout or
stderr; the protocol is byte-identical in all three modes.

# reproduce NEC-2's behaviour, mesh walk and all" rather than "what does a
# better-converged basis say". It has no `-converged` twin on purpose: the

# respond with something like NEC2text#.# things will work") and verified
# against the 5.1a0 bytecode (issue #828; grammar doc, 2026-08-09 addendum):
# a versionNECd match calls ``setVersion(line)`` and returns success — group(1)
# is never read, nothing is Double-parsed, there is no version floor, and NO
# engine state is set. The engine enum (and with it the daemon class, the
# sensor-row offsets, and every dialect switch) comes from the EXECUTABLE
# FILENAME alone, so the binary must keep ``nec2c`` in its name (and its path
# must not contain the substring ``out``). The string SimNEC stores is shown
# in the portal dialog's NECVersion row, echoed back to us as a ``CM version``
# card on every deck, and re-read once by ``Options.getEngine()``, whose
# ``[a-zA-Z]*([0-9])+?(.*)`` must extract "2" (the W7EL insulation gate tests
# it) — which is why the identity must start with ``NEC2`` (exact case, and a
# non-digit right after the 2) and why the tail after it is genuinely free.
# The #.# tail is genuinely free on the NECd path, so it carries the real
# package version — **momwire's own**, since #846 phase III moved the portal
# inside the engine (design doc §5). The engine's version is the number that
# changes solve results, so this is the semantically correct thing for the
# probe to report: under any wrapper-package scheme the probe reports a number
# that can sit still while the engine under it moves. The optics cost was taken
# deliberately and once: the tail went DOWN at the move (antennaknobs 0.52 →
# momwire 0.30), and it restarts lower to track the thing that matters.
# installed-metadata caveat: an editable install reports the version recorded
# at `pip install -e` time, so a dev box that skipped the reinstall after a bump
# probes the stale number — cosmetic there, and always correct on a wheel

    — nothing else. The four integer columns of the echo are read as integers
    and used by nothing; a bare ``GD`` echoes four zero integers and six zero
    reals and runs the deck exactly as a fully populated one does.

    **Which card carries it.** ``GD`` is the obvious one, and the only one
    ``nec2/NECSource`` writes. It is not the only one that works: a ``GN``
    whose ``NRADL`` count is zero carries the same four values in ``F3``-``F6``
    and NEC's card reader writes them into the same four ``/FPAT/`` slots
    (``nec2dx.f`` main program, the ``GN`` branch at label 23 vs the ``GD``
    branch at label 34), so a deck can state a whole cliff without ever
    sending a ``GD``. Both routes land here, and a
    later card overwrites an earlier one exactly as it does in the oracle.

    ``F3``      ``CLT`` — distance from the origin to the edge where the
                two media join (the cliff's EDGE DISTANCE)
    ``F4``      ``CHT`` — height of medium 2's surface relative to
                medium 1's, signed (negative = the far side is lower)
    ==========  =========================================================

    which names all four fields in card order.

    **Why it had to land.** SimNEC's EZNEC-derived examples — ``Cardioid
    (EZNEC).ssn``, ``4-square (EZNEC).ssn`` — carry a ``GD`` and ``NECSource``
    forwards it verbatim, so refusing the card failed those decks outright and
    SimNEC fabricated readouts from the failure (R = 0, X = 0; the same shape
    of live failure the ``EK`` card caused, grammar doc §17).

    **What it changes outside the far field: nothing.** No ``DATA CARD`` line
    beyond its own echo, no line in the ``ANTENNA ENVIRONMENT`` block — not
    even under ``GN 2``, where a second medium might plausibly have announced
    itself — and no change to any number in the matrix path. Fixtures
    ``dipole_gd_second_medium`` and ``dipole_gd_cliff_sommerfeld`` are
    ``dipole_pec_ground`` and ``dipole_sommerfeld_ground`` plus one card, and
    the only differences in either printout are the echo itself and the
    ordinals it shifts. NEC-2 uses the second medium in the FAR FIELD alone;
    the moment method never sees it, so every impedance and every segment
    current is the flat-ground one.

    It is also **not an arming card**: measured on the oracle, ``... XQ / GD
    2 0 0 0 13. .005 0. 0. / XQ`` prints one block, not two. A ``GD`` alone
    does not make the next execute card a real run.

    **Where it does bite: the ``RP`` card's cliff modes.** The far field
    reaches this record only through ``RP 2`` and ``RP 3`` (and the screen
    combinations 5 and 6, which this engine refuses for the screen's sake, not
    the cliff's). Measured both ways on the oracle:

    * under ``RP 0`` the ``RADIATION PATTERNS`` table is byte-identical with
      and without the card — the property ``dipole_gd_*`` still pins;
    * under ``RP 2`` and ``RP 3`` it is not: a ``FAR FIELD GROUND PARAMETERS``
      block appears and the gains move by several dB at grazing angles.

    Those two modes were refused outright until issue #802, which is what made
    accepting the card safe in the first place. They now run —
    :func:`_cliff_image_moments` implements the medium selection — so this
    record is load-bearing rather than a receipt, and the honesty argument has
    moved from "we are never asked" to "we answer it the way ``FFLD`` does".

    writes ``EX 1 …``, ``PT -1``, ``XQ``, ``PT -2`` — which made it look
    entangled with an excitation this engine does not model. It is not. The

    **What the card is.** ``MP <#Proc> <blockSize>`` — two INTEGER fields, and
    nothing else; a fractional one is refused by the oracle
    (``NON-NUMERICAL CHARACTER '.' IN INTEGER FIELD``) and is refused here.
    ``nec2/NECSource.constructNECFile`` writes it as ``"MP %d %d\\n"`` from
    ``NEC2PortalDialog.getMPInfo()[1:]`` — the last two fields of the
    ``necMP #segs #Proc blockSize`` preference, default ``256 16 32``.

    **When SimNEC emits it.** Automatically, and on structure SIZE alone:
    ``constructNECFile`` accumulates ``Wire.numSegments`` over
    ``Task.allWiresForNEC()`` and appends the card — immediately before the
    ``FR`` — when that total reaches ``getMPInfo()[0]`` and the selected engine
    is ``NECEngine.NEC2C``. No user ever asks for it, so any array past 256
    segments simply arrives carrying one. That is why refusing it was not
    tenable: it made the portal fail on exactly the decks worth running.

    **What it changes in the printout.** One line, at column 0, straight after
    the ``ANTENNA ENVIRONMENT`` block and followed by one extra blank —
    ``MP: multiProcessor <#Proc> <blockSize>`` — printed only when the card
    actually asks for parallelism (``MP 1 32`` and ``MP 0 0`` echo and say
    nothing; see :meth:`parallel` for the exact, slightly odd, test).
    It reprints in every block that rebuilds the matrix,
    so an ``FR`` sweep shows it once per frequency. Everything else in the
    printout is byte identical: the fixtures ``dipole_mp_multiprocessor`` and
    ``dipole_mp_single_process`` are ``dipole_free_space``'s geometry, and the
    only other differences are the card echo and the ordinals after it.

    **Why ignoring #Proc and blockSize is correct.** The card describes how the
    ORACLE fills and factors its matrix; it is not physics, and it cannot be —
    the printed numbers are identical with and without it. momwire's
    parallelism is decided elsewhere and earlier: the BLAS/OpenMP pools behind
    numpy, scipy and pynec_accel are configured once per process at import time
    via ``threadpoolctl`` (see ``web/server.py``'s thread-policy block and
    issue #377 — env pins set after the package ``__init__`` are already too
    late, because every pool snapshots its environment at load). A per-deck
    card arriving on stdin cannot reach back into that decision, and honouring
    it would mean re-limiting live pools mid-solve for a hint the sender did
    not mean as a request. It is advisory: we say we saw it, and solve the way
    the process was configured to solve.

    A hostile field is still harmless here. ``MP -3 -9`` makes the oracle
    itself hang forever (measured: SIGTERM at 25 s); this engine just echoes it

      and every azimuth crosses alike.

    one: a single specular bounce off whichever flat half-plane the reflection
    point happens to sit on, with no diffraction at the edge and no shadowing
    by the step. It is trustworthy where the edge is many wavelengths from

    **Why not a chain of Hertzian point dipoles.** That form is algebraically

    where it physically is (the nodes) and makes ΔI small wherever the current
    is smooth, so adjacent nodes cancel the way the continuous integral does.

# The protocol is stateless per deck — every deck re-sends its whole geometry
# and a sweep arrives as N independent decks — but nothing in it forbids the
# ENGINE remembering. ``DeckSolver`` already caches (geometry, frequency) →
# factors WITHIN a deck; this keeps the whole ``DeckSolver`` across decks, so a
# re-probed structure reuses the parse, the mesh, the port maps, the network
# rows AND the per-frequency fills, and the same structure at a new frequency
# pays only the new fill (issue #823).
#
# What a hit must guarantee is that the cached instance is the operator the
# arriving deck asks for. That makes the key the whole contract: it is built

# formatting cannot split it) and it carries EVERYTHING that moves a number in
# the operator — see ``_operator_key``.

# measures the hit rate a live session would see without serving anything.

# the cache degrades to exactly the pre-#823 behaviour when it is full (every
# arrival misses and re-solves). It is a SAFETY NET rather than a working

    material — a ``LD 5`` conductivity or an ``IS`` jacket lands in the fill),
    the ground, the port set in order, and the loads whose gaps the fill has
    to cut. Two decks that differ only in spelling produce the same model and
    therefore the same key.

    Everything that changes the matrix, the drive columns, or their ordering:

    * the wires — geometry after every ``GM``/``GS`` transform, both
      connection passes and the junction shatter;
    * the ground — kind and constants, and its ABSENCE (free space is a
      distinct value, not a missing one), plus the plane's height;
    * the loads — position and :class:`~momwire.deck.model.LoadSpec`, which is
      the set ``_load_impedances`` stamps and the set that cuts gaps;
    * the port set, in order — the model's own feed union;
    * the kernel flag, per execute group — see below;
    * the basis: solver class, solver kwargs and banner suffix. One process has
      one ``--basis``, so this can never differ between two live decks; it is in
      the key anyway because a self-contained key cannot be read wrong.

    Deliberately NOT in the key, because none of them move the operator:

    * ``FR`` — frequency is the key of ``DeckSolver.at``, one level down. Two
      decks alike but for their ``FR`` SHARE this entry and that is the point.
    * ``EX`` VOLTAGES — X's columns are per-1 V and the voltage applies at
      readout (``solve_group``). Only an EX's PLACEMENT is in the key, via the

      control, computed from the result after the solve.
    * ``CM``/``CE`` comments, and card formatting — the key is built from the
      parsed deck, so a re-sent deck that differs only in whitespace hits.
    * ``GD`` — the second medium reaches NEC's far field only through ``RP``'s
      cliff modes and moves nothing in the operator (grammar doc §12.6). It is
      excluded so a GD knob-drag HITS, which is safe because a hit rebinds
      ``portal_deck`` to the arriving deck (``_solver_for``): no cached
      instance ever carries a stale ``GD``, whatever a later far-field path
      chooses to read. ``test_a_gd_card_change_hits_and_still_answers_fresh``
      is the proof, and it compares against a FRESH PROCESS rather than
      against itself, so it stays a proof if ``GD`` ever grows a far field.

    ``EK`` used to be the conservative entry — kept on the argument that a
    card whose whole meaning is "compute the operator differently" must never
    be answered from an entry built without it, even while momwire had no
    other kernel to build with. Since issue #849 it is an ordinary one: the
    flag IS the operator now (``DeckSolver.at`` fills per kernel), and a wrong
    hit here would serve a reduced-kernel answer to a deck that asked for the
    extended one. The tuple stays per GROUP, because that is the granularity
    the card has.
